      <p>The Sith Empire was the name shared by a series of empires ruled by the Sith that existed long before the Galactic Empire. The Sith Empires at various moments once controlled most of the galaxy, and often fought against 
the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order in a series of wars and battles, including the Great Hyperspace War, the Sith Wars, the Great Scourge of Malachor, the crusade of Krath, and other conflicts, until the last Sith Empire 
collapsed. The Sith empire had many armed forces. Their main army consisted of enlisted soldiers who worked under officers
who would sometime report to member of the Sith. Within the Sith organization (the leaders of the Sith empire) there were many dark lords who often worked in one of two groups, the Sith warrior or the Sith inquisitors. These groups
 often reported to a master who trained them in the ways of the Sith. The whole Sith order was led by the Dark council who reported to the Sith Emperor who spoke through his direct followers as he had not been seen in years. The economy of
the empire was interesting. When the Sith Empire dominated the galaxy, gemstones were freely traded, although this caused a flooding of the market and the value of gemstones dropped until bans and limits were put in place. Additionally, 
trade occurred on at least one planet a Sith Empire controlled. The Sith Empires traditionally used slave labor to build their structures. The Sith empire being made by the Sith used the dark side of the force. These governments were built
on the back of slave labor, a practice that the Galactic Republic outlawed during its stewardship of the galaxy. The idea of an enormous, spacefaring, planet-destroying superweapon had dated back to the Sith Empire, tyrants were
playing with the idea of a weapon so powerful it could destroy entire worlds. Although only a few super weapons were produced by the Sith empire it wasn’t until the success of Darth Sidious where it came to fruition with the Death
Star battle station. The Sith empire eventually fell after many of the Sith made powerplays killing each other off.</p>

     <h3 id="legendssithempire">Legends</h3>
     <h4>Quick Summary</h4>
     <p>The Sith Empire, later known as the Old Sith Empire or Original Sith Empire, was a rich and powerful empire in the outer rim established by Dark Jedi who were banished from the galactic Republic after their defeat at the Battle 
of Corbos during the Hundred-Year Darkness. The Jedi exiles fled to the remote world of Koriban, where after conquering it, they interbred with the native Sith species through the art of Sith alchemy, beginning a long period of building
and expansion. The Sith empire developed in complete isolation within the Stygian Caldera for two thousand years before it eventually rediscovered the republic. Under the leadership of the Dark Lord Naga Shadow, the Empire invaded republic
space during the Great Hyperspace War, but it was defeated. The Sith Empire was believed to have been destroyed by republic forces during the second battle of Koriban. However, the Sith Lord Darth Vitiate survived the destruction and led
many of the remaining Sith in the rebuilding the Sith Empire in the Unknown Regions. Though the original Sith empire was defeated, it served as an example to be followed by numerus identical named empires in later eras.</p>

     <h3 id="historysithempire">History</h3>
      <h4>Origin</h4>
      <p>The Sith civilization began around the year 100,000 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), by which time a species of red skinned humanoids had evolved on the planet Koriban. They lived a barbaric, yet strangely harmonious, existence 
filled with constant warring between the various divided nations on their world. During the pre-industrial age by 30,000 BBY, the inhabitants of Korriban fought off an incursion from the Kiliks. It was under the iron rule of King Adas that 
the Sith first became unified. He was declared the Sith ‘Ari, the ultimate being. It was he who first formed a Sith Empire around the year 28,000 BBY, and his reign lasted for three centuries. The relative stability of this empire was first
challenged in 27,700 BBY when the Sith were visited by the Rakata. These aliens from the distance infinite Empire Attempted to lull the ancient Sith King into their confidence by providing him with the great Holocrons. However, their true
motivation of conquest quickly became apparent. This led to King Adas bringing the full might of the Sith Empire to bear on the Rakata, and he succeeded in diving them away from the Korriban at the cost of his life. Using the remains of
the enemy craft, the once primitive Sith were propelled into a space age and were armed with the power of the dark side of the force. Using these newly acquired tools from the Infinite Empire, the Sith Empire conquered other nearby worlds
which became part of Sith Space and relocated their capitol from ancient Korriban to the neighboring world of Ziost. Several pure-blooded Sith also established a library-temple on the world of Krayiss II around 14.000 BBY where they 
slumbered and their spirits continued to haunt the temple for the next 10,000 years. The reign of the empire was short lived, however, as it dissolved into civil war after the death of King Adas, leaving his people to regress into a more
primitive state. Around the year 7000 BBY, a civil war was initiated by Dathka Graush, which left most of the cities of Korriban in ruin. A group of Sith priests of the Kissai caste interpreted death of Adas as a sign to reject the dark 
side dominated beliefs of their people. Labeled as heretics for their actions, these Sith were banished and settled the planet Tund, where they became the Sorcerers of Tund. The planet Arkania also fell under the dominion of the Sith, and 
by 7000 BBY, they had established a library known as Veeshas Tuwan on it. Around the year 6900 BBY, exiled fallen Jedi fleeing from the battle of Corbos, which concluded the Hundred-Year Darkness, landed on Korriban, a desolate world 
inhabited by the relatively primitive but unusually Force-sensitive with people. Upon Arriving, the Dark Jedi attempted to subjugate the Sith and take whatever knowledge they possessed. The Sith attempted to protect their secrets, but they
fell to the superior straining and technology of the invaders. Using their training in the Force, the fallen Jedi amazed the Sith, and elevated themselves to god-like status on Korriban, becoming the rulers of the Sith people. Over the next
two thousand years, interbreeding occurred between the fallen Jedi and the Sith by means of Sith alchemy, which lead to the term "Sith" being used to identify not only the original inhabitants of Koriban but also the fallen Jedi Masters.
This intermingling between the two species continued across hundreds of generations, and the hybridized offspring of this union became a sacred mausoleum-world. One of the first Sith Lords of this new empire was Ajunta Pall, whom the native
Sith views as am incarnation of their primary god.</p>

     <h4 id="governmentandpoliticssithempire">Government and Politics</h4>
     <p>Much of the structure of the Empire had changed following 6900 BBY due to the arrival of the Dark Jedi Exiles. Their government was ultimately led by a cabal of Sith Lords with a single Dark lord who served as the ruler of his people.
It was these individuals that controlled the now Force-using magocracy of the Sith Empire, their society also was left in a state of perpetual conflict as these rivals Sith Lords often raised their own personal armies to unseat the 
ruling Dark Lord. The title of Dark Lord of the Sith was typically given to the individual by their decreased predecessor who manifested as a Dark Side Spirit after being interred within their tomb. The cabal beneath him were the Sith Council
who were a body of advisors to the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith. It consisted of ten members made up of Sith Lords within the Empire. Each Lord on the Council personally ruled over a dozen worlds. This council convened in a great citadel on 
Ziost. In this ancient age, the Lords of the Sith Empire were the undisputed masters of the worlds that fell under their control. Political factions were also known to exist within the ranks of the government of the Sith Empire with such
coalitions formed around specific Sith Lords.</p> 

     <h3 id="societyandculturesithempire">Society and Culture</h3>
     <p>Culturallly, the Sith Empire was a different from that of the Republic, being much more ecumenically-driven than its counterpart. The Sith Empire was hieratchical, utilizing both a pigid castle system adn a stratified rank structure 
to put its subject in their proper place. Due to how long Sith society has seperated the Sith into castes (across approximately 100,000 years), Each caste was something refered to as a sub-species of Sith. The Kissai were the priest caste 
of the sithwho also served as spiritual leaders that indoctrinated other in into Sith teachings. This was most likely where the mages and other practitoners of their ancient and mysterious magic were placed. In contrast, the Massassi were
the warrior caste of the Sith. They were unswervingly obedient to the Dark Lord. The Sith engineer caste built adn maintained Sith technology, including droids and starships. Sith slaves were the lowliest caste of the Sith. They worshipped
the Sith Lords as gods, and were oftehn used as sacrifices. The Sith Lords used them for slave labor and menial tasks. Most citizens of the Empire lived in this meager caste driven structure where they toiled to build their rulers tomb or
dying by the millions in internecine warfare. Thye were ultimately ruled by a military styled culture with a great reverence for the dead. When a sith Lord dies, his slaves where buried alive with his body in his tomb on Korriban. When Adas
unified the Sith nations, he took the title of "Sith'Ari" which translated, meant "Sith Overlord" in Basic. They were the leaders of the Sith. Each Sith lord has his own slaves and his own army of Massasi while hte Sith'Ari ruled over the Sith
Lords also. Following the death of Adas, many clamed the title of Sith'Ari and fought each other in constant civil wars, each ruling only a Fief. Followinf 6900 BBY, the current Sith'Ari was killed and the Sith Interbred with teh Jen'jidai,
resulting in a mix of Ancient Sith and baseline Human species traits, resulting in many losing and low-light vision which most Ancient Sith possessed. Following the fall of the Sith Empire in 5000 BBY, the word Sith'Ari took the appoximate
meaning "Chosen One" when later Sith, referring to an unidentified individual who whould fulfill a particular Sith prophecy, this prophecy was later fulfilled by Darth Bane. The term "Jen'Ari" was the title translated "Dark lord of the Sith"
in Basic. Jen'Ari were the greatest and most powerful of the Sith Lords who took the place of the Sith'Ari in the Sith hierarchy. There was only one Jen'Ari at a time , who was the head of teh Sith Council and ruler of the Sith Empire. The
original Jen'ari were Jen'jidai; later Jen'ari were Sith Lords who assumed the title after the death of the previous Jen'jidai, defeating any rival claimant to the title in combat (often resulting in death, or at least disfigurement). From
6,900 BBY to 5,000 BBY, the Sith Lords collectively ruled the Empire through a governing body known as the Sith Council, which the Jen'ari ruled over and commanded; each member of the Council had a personal fleet. Many Jen'ari had partial
Jen'jidai ancestry, which was, in some, considered more desirable. After the fall of the Sith Empire, the title "Dark Lord of the Sith" was used by both the leader of the Sith Order (such as Exar Kun or Revan) and his apprentice (such as 
Ulic Qel-Droma or Malak), although it is uncertain if the title "Jen'ari" remained in use in any capacity, or was abandoned for the title "Darth". Before the formation of the Sith Empire, the Sith were engaged in constant warfare with one 
another though this was seen as an acceptable practice as they believed it to be a fundamental aspect of their existence. This meant that they lived both a barbaric yet strangely harmonious existence on their homeworld. The early Sith often 
engaged in sentient sacrifices which they made to their deities. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. After the arrival of
the Exiles, only those that were Force-sensitive had the capacity to reach the upper echlons of the Sith Empire. Those that were blind to the Force were considered useless; fit for only common labor purposes or simple bureaucratic work. Amongst 
the elite, power was craved due to the intense feelings of greed perpetrated by the dark side which also meant that these individuals were also ambitious as well as paranoid. This society encouraged the survival of the fittest with only the most 
ruthless and powerful rising to positions of power as well as surviving. This empire ultimately thrived on slavery as well as exploitation and oppression of the masses. In addition, they lived in constant belief that they would face external 
threats to their dominion and thus had a belief in expansion or dying. Some believed that this was a necessity for the Sith as they hungered for new lands and riches to bring under their control. This allowed for Naga Sadow to lead his forces 
during the Great Hyperspace War though despite this being the case, there were other traditional and more conservative factions that believed in remaining within their territory in order to preserve their ways. During the time of the first Sith 
Empire, there were many instances of travelers stumbling into Sith space where they became slaves to one of the many members of the nobility. Over the years of enslavement, these aliens and outsiders continued to live for generations whereupon 
they forgot their origins thus turning them into true subjects of the Sith. Some Sith Lords even found value in the descendants of these foreigners such as those of the Tapani worlds due to their skills in science. Natural born Sith tended to 
focus on sorcery while the Tapani's excellence in the fields of science meant that they became valued members of the Empire and developed the industrial as well as medical infrastructure for several Sith Lords. Through such means as those 
presented by the Tapani, the Sith developed new lightsaber construction techniques that were more advanced than those produced by either Sith or Jedi. However, the intense rivalry and fierce competitive nature of Sith society meant that ranking 
Sith Lords never shared these new developments or weapons. Among the Sith, about glorification of self and the subjugation of others was a constant aspect within their society.One of the greatest secrets of the ancient Sith was their devotion to 
the arts of Sith sorcery. As such, those individuals that practiced this art took on the title of Sith mages who held great mystical power that allowed them to cause stars to go supernova. The original Sith were also quite skilled in the art of 
Sith alchemy though it was the Dark Jedi Exiles who later became Sith Lords that perfected the ability. Originally, the species was a united people who instead preferred to stay within different and divided tribes. These were led by one or more
sorcerers who were in charge with the groups protection. This remained the case until the arrival of the Exiles who took interest in the species' techniques in drawing on the power of the dark side of the Force which they used to accomplish their 
sorcery. This practice was used by pure blood Sith who often dwelled in Library-temples where they sat in meditation as well as recorded their experiences as well as experiments. They also created many tools designed to enhance or project their 
power which was commonly seen in Sith talismans. These dark side empowered constructs were capable of a wide range of feats from being simple concentration tools to being a trap that turned other Force users to the dark side when being used or 
defensive tools that absorbed weapon fire and even being used for healing. They also created special chambers and sanctuaries that amplified the power of the Force which were either used as Meditation chamber or Focusing chambers. One of the greater
feats was the capacity to create sentient vessels such as Meditation Spheres that were capable of enhancing the power of a Sith sorcerer.The Sith Empire had also made use of droids and recognized their potential as security troops leading to several 
different designs to be produced. Schematics for these droids were often stored within holocrons and though their inner workings were inferior to later generation droids, the fact that Sith alchemy was used in their construction meant that their outer 
plating was equal to a low powered shield generator.</p>

     <h4>Quick summary</h4>
     <p>The Republic Era, also known as the era of the Republic, the Age of Republic, or the Great Peace, was a period in galactic history marked by the rise and fall of the Galactic Republic. Following the fall of the Old Republic, the Republic Era 
commenced with the establishment of the modern Galactic Republic. Aided by the Knights of the Jedi Order, the Galactic Senate of the Republic governed the galaxy in a time of peace that lasted for roughly a millennium. According to Janyor, the Republic 
gradually declined under a stagnant bureaucracy and political corruption, and its final years were remembered as the Twilight of the Republic or the Twilight of the Old Republic. The Invasion of Naboo, followed by the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars, 
marked the Republic's transition from a democracy to a military dictatorship under Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. This thirteen-year period from 32 BBY to 19 BBY became known as the fall of the Republic. In the aftermath of the implementation of Order 
66, which saw the collapse of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Jedi's annihilation, Palpatine—the Sith Lord Darth Sidious—proclaimed himself Galactic Emperor, transforming the Republic into the First Galactic Empire. The Republic Era concluded 
with the dawn of the Imperial Era. Historians regarded the Republic Era as the "last era of peace." After it ended, the Empire ruled the galaxy under the New Order's fascist ideology, leading to the Galactic Civil War with the Alliance to Restore the Republic, 
which became known as the Age of Rebellion. The New Republic sought to restore peace and democracy to the galaxy; however, the New Republic Era's last years were marked by a Cold War with the First Order, a successor state of the Old Empire, and ended with the 
New Republic's destruction. As a result, open war broke out between the First Order and the Resistance, until a pan-galactic uprising against the First Order took place.</p>

    <h3 id="historyrepublic">History</h3>
    <p>Roughly a thousand years before the invasion of Naboo, the Jedi and the Sith were at war with each other. The Sith were eventually defeated when the greed for power caused them to turn on each other, which allowed the Jedi to defeat the weakened Sith, 
leaving them all but destroyed. However, one Sith Lord emerges as the sole survivor: Darth Bane. Realizing that the Sith's greed led to their demise, Bane decided that the Sith needed to operate in secret to get revenge, favoring guile and conspiracy rather 
than brute force. With that, he formed the Rule of Two, which mandated that only two Sith Lords could exist at any given time: a master to represent the power of the dark side of the Force, and an apprentice to train under the master and one day fulfill their role. 
Darth Bane took on an apprentice of his own, Darth Zannah, who was rumored to have killed Bane on Ambria in a lightsaber duel; nonetheless, Bane's apprentice continued his tradition and moved forward with the Grand Plan. During this time, the Galactic Republic was 
reformed, and the Jedi Order enjoyed political ascension, rebuilding the Jedi Temple on the capital world of Coruscant to train Jedi younglings in the way of the Force. The High Republic Era was a particular part of the Republic's reign where the government was at 
the height of its power. The Republic Era, also known as the "era of the Republic,” the "Age of Republic,” or the "Great Peace," was characterized by the lack of galaxy-spanning wars, although some smaller sector and system conflicts, such as the Stark Hyperspace 
War or the Mandalorian Civil War, consumed the time and energy of the Republic and the Jedi. Nevertheless, it was remembered by Janyor and other New Republic period historians as the last era of peace in galactic history. The "Twilight of the Republic,” also known 
as the "Twilight of the Old Republic," referred to the Republic Era in its final years. Long after Bane's rule was introduced, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis took on an apprentice, Darth Sidious, the Sith persona of Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo. Sidious 
eventually killed his master in his sleep when he had no use for him anymore. One event that took place in this time was the election of Padmé Amidala as Queen of Naboo. The "fall of the Republic" began with Sidious instigating several conflicts in the galaxy in order 
to gain power, beginning with the Invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation. He used this incident to cause then Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to be voted out of office, manipulating Queen Amidala into calling for the vote over her anger at the Galactic Senate's 
inaction over the invasion; Valorum was replaced by Senator Palpatine himself. Further governmental inaction and corruption ultimately led to the Separatist Crisis, in which thousands of worlds seceded from the Republic and formed a separate government, the Confederacy 
of Independent Systems. Tensions fostered between the two factions through the machinations of Sidious and his Sith apprentice, Darth Tyranus, who led the Separatists through his public identity as Count Dooku, ultimately led to the outbreak of the pan-galactic Clone Wars 
in 22 BBY. The First Battle of Geonosis marked the end of the Great Peace and the beginning of the Clone Wars; having mobilized a clone army to serve as its new military, the Republic went to war against the Separatists, led by the former Jedi-turned-Sith Lord Count Dooku. 
The Sith had not completely died out at the end of their war with the Jedi, and had been plotting for centuries to overthrow the Jedi and the Republic. The Clone Wars raged for three years, during which the Republic became an increasingly militarized state in the name of order 
and security against the Separatist threat. Chancellor Palpatine, whose term was already extended due to the Separatist Crisis, remained in office for the duration of the conflict, all the while centralizing political and military authority in the Office of the Chancellor through 
the various wartime emergency powers granted to him by the Galactic Senate. After he and Dooku manipulated Rush Clovis and orchestrated the Separatist takeover of Scipio, another power given to Chancellor Palpatine was control of the InterGalactic Banking Clan. In the waning days 
of the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, the Separatists suffered a series of major defeats, including the deaths of Dooku and General Grievous at the hands of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, respectively. Meanwhile, the Jedi High Council, who became increasingly 
wary of Palpatine due to his unprecedented wartime powers, discovered his identity as the enigmatic Sith Lord Darth Sidious. The Jedi's attempt to apprehend him ultimately failed and fostered Skywalker's fall to the dark side and rechristening as Sidious' new apprentice, Darth Vader. 
Vader was subsequently sent to lead the Siege of the Jedi Temple. Simultaneously, Palpatine instituted Order 66 to the Republic Army, beginning the initial part of the systematic destruction of the Jedi Order, as clone troopers executed their Jedi Generals across the galaxy. With 
the Jedi Order decimated, Palpatine gave the proclamation of the New Order to an emergency session of the Galactic Senate, where he declared the Jedi enemies of the state, while transforming the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Galactic Emperor. At the 
same time, Vader destroyed the Separatist Council and deactivated the Droid Army, effectively ending the Clone Wars and cementing the return of the galaxy to the rule of the Sith. </p>

     <h3 id="legendsrepublic">Legends</h3>
     <p>The Great Peace of the Republic was a time period that lasted from the Battle of Ruusan in 1000 BBY to the Clone Wars that began in 22 BBY. This peace ended when Supreme Chancellor Palpatine declared war on the Confederacy of Independent Systems after the First Battle of 
Geonosis.</p>

     <p>The Chiss Ascendancy, known as just the Ascendancy, was an aristocratic oligarchical nation of the near-human Chiss located inside the Unknown Regions of the galaxy. The Chiss Ascendancy was an interconnection of individual sovereignties and was strictly isolationist to outsiders, 
preferring a libertarian approach to the wider galaxy and even had a strict policy prohibiting first strikes. The Ascendancy was regarded as mostly a legend even within the Unknown Regions. The history of the Chiss Ascendancy was long and ancient, dating at least as far back as the Sith Wars 
between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. However, due to its isolationism, it almost never involved itself in affairs that existed beyond the bounds of its own space. The Ascendancy's isolationism was so strong, it kept its presence hidden from other powers in the galaxy. The Chiss 
Ascendency was not inherently expansionistic, instead pursuing exploration and research. Indeed, the Ascendancy had strict guidelines prohibiting preemptive strikes; setting rules of engagement that required confirmation of impending or previous attack before the Ascendancy's Fleet could fire 
on any target. The government and politics of the Chiss Ascendancy were dominated by the constructs of Chiss families. Each Chiss family had a hierarchy, and there was another level of hierarchy amongst families. The Nine Ruling Families of the Chiss Syndicure held the highest level of executive, 
legislative, and economic power; followed by the Forty Great Houses, and other families having the least influence. Family politics—both within and between families—drove much of the politics of the Ascendancy, and even bled into the operations of the Chiss Defense Force even though it wasn't supposed 
to. The Chiss Ascendancy eventually discovered a mysterious threat in the Unknown Regions, when it deduced that the nascent Galactic Empire would be both a suitable ally and easy prey for the threat to attack instead of the Ascendancy.</p>

    <h3 id="historychissascendancy">History</h3>
    <p>The Chiss remembered teachings of ancient philosophers, many of whom felt that all war was madness. According to stories told by later generations, the founding of the Ascendancy occurred at a time when the Stybla family was the only Chiss family to hold "Ruling Family" status, marking it as the 
First Ruling Family. Over the subsequent years, the number of Ruling Families rose and fell; at times, there were as many as twelve Ruling Families, while other time periods only saw as few as three Chiss families hold the rank. The Ascendancy also grew in power, becoming the subject of legend to other 
nations within the Unknown Regions. Over a thousand years before the Nikardun conquests, during a climax of a great war fought between the Chiss Ascendancy and an enemy, the Chiss were forced back to Csilla. Despite their earlier losses, the Chiss Ascendancy were forced to use an ancient alien weapon 
known as the Starflash. However, the weapon also affected Csilla's sun, causing it to cool and make the surface of the planet uninhabitable. That caused a Chiss exodus moved to planets such as Avidich, Rentor and Sarvchi. This exodus to other worlds was kept a secret from most in the Ascendancy. Instead, 
historical accounts of the event taught that Csilla's population had moved underground, leaving out the fact that the number of Chiss below the surface was far below the population of four billion before Csilla's climate change. Nevertheless, the headquarters of both the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet 
and Chiss Syndicure, along with many merchant and cargo installations, were kept on Csilla. Additionally, most of the Chiss Ruling Families did not want to abandon their capital world entirely, though some did move their homesteads to other planets. By the time Mitth'raw'nuruodo had command of the Boco, 
the population on Csilla numbered around sixty to seventy million, with some living aboveground to maintain the illusion of a thriving capital. In another point of Chiss history, which was not remembered fondly by subsequent generations, the Chiss Ascendancy adventured into the wider galaxy and participated 
in the Sith Wars, a series of conflicts between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The Ascendancy encountered a number of aliens before retreating to their borders, losing some wealth and technology in the process. Rumors spread amongst the other nations of the Unknown Regions that the Chiss had 
joined the conflicts in what they knew as "Lesser Space," yet their tales of those events remained unconfirmed. The Chiss themselves remembered their ventures into the greater galaxy as being ill-advised affairs. The Chiss Ascendancy had records of many battles against the Grysk Hegemony, including some 
that they participated in and others they simply observed the Grysk. Around 150 BBY, the Coduyo family was removed from the number of Ruling Families, while the Xodlak family was removed from ruling status around 68 BBY. As such, there were only Nine Ruling Families by the time of the Clone Wars that 
occurred in "Lesser Space." Years prior to the Nikardun conquests, the Chiss Defense Force had only been tasked with the internal defense of Ascendancy space. The Defense Force had long pled with the Syndicure for a larger mandate and stronger capabilities. Eventually, the Aristocra agreed, establishing 
the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet with the mission to "watch over Chiss interests in the parts of the Chaos extending beyond the Ascendancy's borders, to learn who was out there and assess their level of threat." Many new ships, bases, and support facilities were constructed for the Expansionary Fleet, 
which needed many competent officers and warriors. It was at that time that a young Chiss named Kivu'raw'nuru was recruited from the planet of Rentor to join the Mitth family. In the early days of the Expansionary Defense Fleet, the Ascendancy was uninterested in forming friendly diplomatic ties with other 
nations of the Chaos. During that time, Junior Commander Mitth'raw'nuru sought to launch the Lioaoin pirate campaign, promising General Ba'kif to distinguish between "hostiles and friendlies." Ba'kif responded that the Ascendancy had barely acknowledged the presence of other peoples and was not interested 
in friendships with them, instead charging Thrawn with distinguishing between "hostiles and neutrals." Some time after the Lioaoin pirate campaign and prior to the Nikardun conquests, the Chiss Ascendancy launch a series of operations against Vagaari pirates. The Chiss were able to defeat the Vagaari. But, 
while the operations were a success in a military sense, they were a political disaster for the Ascendancy, with Syndic Mitth'ras'safis left dead, causing uproar in the higher echelons of Chiss society. Supreme Admiral Ja'fosk of the Ascendancy was displeased with the operation, as were the Aristocra. </p>

     <h3 id="organizationchissascendancy">Organization</h3>
     <p>Called a "nation" like other powers within the Unknown Regions, the Chiss Ascendancy was a hegemonic empire and was comprised of interconnected sovereignties governed by the noble houses that made up the Aristocra, a sociopolitical body who were mid-level members of the empire's Nine Ruling Families. 
The Aristocra were collectively conglomerated to serve, represent, and unite the Chiss species as a whole, thereby bringing them under one common order. Most notably, the Aristocra effectively constituted the governmental hierarchy and bureaucracy of the Chiss, known as the Chiss Syndicure, the collective 
leadership of the Ascendancy, that was located in both Assembly Cupola and Convocate Hall in Csaplar, the capital city of the Chiss Ascendancy. The power held by the ruling families was that from which the legitimacy of the Aristocra's authority fundamentally derived. As a consequence, they had the power 
to pass legislation and bless decisions to be instituted across the Ascendancy. The Ascendancy military consisted of the Chiss Defense Force, charged with defending Chiss territory, and the Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet, charged with patrolling the Chaos, and were bound by a set of laws restricting 
their authority to perform preemptive strikes and was to "watch over Chiss interests in the parts of the Chaos extending beyond the Ascendancy borders, to learn who was out there and assess their level of threat." In addition to the Expansionary Defense Fleet, many Chiss families had family fleets that 
functioned analogously to planetary defense forces for worlds where that family had a strong presence. All operations of the Chiss Defense Fleet were managed by an admiralty known as the Defense Hierarchy Council, which also held the power to exile traitors for crimes against the Chiss. Chiss officers 
were outfitted with a type of uniform which was able to absorb energy, protecting the user from blaster fire. There were multiple military ranks used in the Chiss Defense Fleet, including the ranks of admiral and commander. Though the Aristocra were not supposed to have influence over assignments in the 
Chiss military, it was still known to happen behind the scenes and against protocol. The fleet used several types of starships, including Chiss warships and Chiss shuttles. The Chiss shuttle was also referred to as a Chiss courier ship. Ozyly-esehembo was a Cheunh word for Force-sensitive Chiss navigators, 
which translated to Galactic Basic Standard as "sky-walker." They were administered by sky-walker corps to navigate through difficult territory in the Unknown Regions. Sky-walkers were Chiss children, usually girls and usually between the ages of seven and fourteen, though some recalled the power sometimes 
lasted until age fifteen. Additionally, the power could sometimes fade ahead of schedule. In contrast to many other galactic empires, the Chiss Ascendancy favored a more libertarian approach in how it conducted itself in galactic affairs, embracing a philosophy of strict non-interventionism and peaceful 
diplomacy. This philosophy was codified via the Chiss laws prohibiting pre-emptive strikes. Although military service was an important component of Chiss culture and heritage, the very notions of conquest and aggressive expansionism were almost universally disdained by society, and such actions would be 
in fundamental defiance of military protocol. Not believing in the preliminary initiation of force, the Chiss only supported going to war in the event that the Ascendancy fell under attack by external forces. Still, official military policy was to do everything possible to avoid a preemptive attack against 
a possible enemy. Though the act of entering another faction's space to gather intelligence was effectively allowed, it was close enough to breaking the rule to cause concern. Despite not allowing involvement in non-Chiss battles without being provoked, the Chiss, who also disallowed deliberate provocation, 
allowed their military ships to provide humanitarian aid if they arrived in the aftermath of such battles. Nevertheless, the Chiss Ascendancy was also generally isolationist, almost never involving itself in affairs that existed beyond the bounds of its own space. Diplomatically speaking, on those rare 
occasions when the Ascendancy did engage in intergalactic matters, the Ascendancy displayed its pacifistic ethos by taking a benevolent approach in its dealings. Despite this, the Ascendancy always exercised extreme caution when doing so, taking measures to ensure that the location of Chiss Space would 
remain hidden, even to leaders of other galactic governments. Even though the Ascendancy had diplomats within its ranks, the Chiss also had very little desire to maintain serious relations with the other "nations" of the Unknown Regions, with some members of the Chiss Ascendancy not even seeing aliens 
as true people.</p>

     <h3 id="societyandculyurechissascendancy">Society and Culture</h3>
     <p>Philosophically speaking, the Ascendancy vindicated its positions through a kind of utilitarian lens, the Chiss themselves being an empirically-minded species. The Chiss saw their government as the inverse of the Chaos that was the Unknown Regions, believing their Ascendancy represented order, 
security, steadfastness, power, glory, light, and culture. Young Chiss were allowed to take a "wandering year" after their basic education to travel throughout the Unknown Regions and learn. After the year, which also allowed the young individual a chance to engage in self–examination and mediation, 
the Chiss was expected to return to their curriculum, whether that be job training or advanced education. The wandering year was a staple of some Chiss families, with supporters of the practice arguing it gave the younger generation a chance to better decide and uncover their talents and goals. 
It was hoped that could prevent false starts during the younger individual's future studies, yet critics of the practice argued there was little evidence of such positives. According to critics of the wandering year tradition, most evidence pointed to the idea that it was simply a year for young 
people to relish in self–indulgent laziness, all while wasting parental funds. A third opinion arose from cynical members of Chiss society, who thought a wandering year was simply an escape for midagers who did not want to deal with what was, at least traditionally, the most condescending and 
pompous time in their entire lives. The wandering year tradition was similar to practices within many other Unknown Region–cultures, yet the Chiss thought it was special to themselves. Indeed, the Chiss were often condescending when dealing with the other species of the Unknown Regions, as if they 
thought they were the only true sentient species in the region. The Chiss language was known as Cheunh, while written communication was done in Cheunh script. The Cheunh script included variants used by government officials that were deliberately hard for observers to read upside-down. In the ancient 
past, the Stybla family used Tybroic as a language, but by around 18 BBY it was only used in ceremonies. In their rare contacts with outsiders, the Chiss used trade languages, such as Sy Bisti, which was used across the Unknown Regions and Wild Space as a means of communication. Other trade languages 
used by the Chiss both within the Chaos and the rare times they ventured to Lesser Space included Taarja and Minnisiat. The social and political structures of the Ascendancy were focused upon the "family" structures, which often generated political infighting. While there were several Ruling Families, 
there were a subsequent number of "Great Families" that, given the proper conditions, could rise to become members of the ruling elite, and thousands of lesser families, which were less influencial than the great houses. Neither the number of Ruling nor Great Families was fixed, with families able to 
rise and fall, and some of the lesser families hoped to join the ranks of the Great, while others were content with their local power blocs. Even though family loyalty was not supposed to impact military decisions, it often unofficially did. While the Syndicure was unable to officially control military 
matters, it could advise, encourage, and, in the words of Thrawn, "make trouble," which was something the politicans were particularly skillful at. Most Chiss names were multi-syllabic and consisted of three distinct parts, as in Mitth'raw'nuruodo. The first portion identified an individual's family, 
the second was the given name, and the third indicated other social factors. A combination of parts of the three portions constituted the individual's core name, such as the derivation of "Thrawn" from "Mitth'raw'nuruodo". The secrets of Second and Third Sights were among the best kept secret in the 
Chiss Ascendancy, to such an extent that many Chiss themselves were unaware of their full extent or even their existence. They were identified with the ability to use the Sight to act as navigators for the CDF and were known as ozyly-esehembo, the Cheunh word for "sky-walker." The existances of the 
sky-walkers was also kept secret from the other species and nations of the Unknown Regions, with the Chiss even hiring alien navigators at times to keep up the illusion of lacking their own. Jixtus came to speculate the Chiss indeed had their own form of hyperspace navigation, yet he incorrectly 
guessed the Chiss means were electronic hyperdrives they claimed during the Sith Wars, though later Grysk agents became aware of the sky-walker corps. Much like how the Galactic Empire showed prejudice towards aliens, the Chiss Ascendancy was known for distrusting humans. When Imperial Commander 
Eli Vanto served the Chiss Defense Fleet, the Chiss treated him similarly to how Grand Admiral Thrawn was treated when he joined the Empire. Nevertheless, all mistrust towards Vanto subsided when he proved his worth. Despite keeping minor relations with the neighboring nations of the Unknown Regions, 
the Chiss saw little need to treat them as allies or equals.</p>

     <h4>Quick Summary</h4>
     <p>The Chiss Ascendancy, sometimes termed Chiss Space or the Chiss Empire by outsiders, was a portion of the galaxy just inside the Unknown Regions that was ruled by the Chiss.</p>

     <h3 id="governmentchissascendancy">Government</h3>
     <p>The Chiss were governed by an oligarchy of extended Ruling Families from House Palace, located in the city of Csaplar. Each clan with the families was headed by leaders known as Aristocra who wore particular colors to indicate their clan and family loyalties. Standard and day-to-day decisions 
were made by a democratically elected parliamentary body from each of the 28 colonies. Issues were siphoned up through the parliament to a cabinet of appointed governors, and then to the ruling families, where a decision made by the parliament and/or cabinet could be approved for action. Each of the 
extended ruling families was responsible for a set of government affairs to manage: House Sabosen was responsible for social issues such as justice, health, and education; House Inrokini was responsible for industry and science; House Csapla was responsible for colonial affairs, agriculture, and 
redistribution of resources; and House Nuruodo was responsible for military and foreign affairs. The Csapla's redistribution of resources amongst the Chiss colonies and Csilla was particularly important, given the collectivist-socialist economic system of the Chiss, and led to their relative position 
at the head of the families, with the others acting in an advisory role. House Nuruodo would be ranked as second, considering the importance of warfare on Chiss society. Each family was equally represented in the Chiss government, although they went to great lengths to ensure that family identity was 
eliminated wherever possible. The leaders of the Chiss did not use names, but instead wore colorful robes to distinguish themselves. This helped ensure that decisions were reached in a fair and equitable method. Although the four extended ruling families were not known to face power struggles, five 
lesser clans often vied for greater authority and power, such as House Chaf, which was considered the fifth ruling family. The vast financial holdings of the Chiss kept their supply lines running and also provided them access to a number of independent shipyards which they used to keep their vessels 
on constant patrol. It was through such methods that the Chiss maintained a poacher base at the Etyyy hunting grounds on Kashyyyk.</p>

     <h3 id="militarychissascendancy">Military</h3>
     <p>The military of the Chiss Ascendancy consisted of a well trained and well armed force which protected a number of advanced and orderly worlds within its sphere of influence. Chiss belief in rigid discipline was further seen within their armed forces and they made use of superior technology when 
required in order to hold enemy forces at bay. Ultimately, the Chiss saw themselves as a bastion of order in a sea of chaos in their home space in the Unknown Regions. While their history was marked by nearly continual warfare and conquest of other worlds, the Chiss were generally not violent. They 
preferred to extend themselves only from a defensive posture, although they were exposed to threats in the Unknown Regions and Outer Rim, such as the Ssi-ruuk and the threat of the Vagaari (who fought three wars with the Chiss), the Yuuzhan Vong War in which is the reason Thrawn went to Palpatine in 
the first place, to help defeat the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong in the Unknown regions, and the later Killik incursion. There were two military organizations: the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force and the Colonial Phalanxes, which were both led by the Nuruodo family. The Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet 
patrolled the Chiss borders and space, although segments were known to combat forces beyond the realm of the Chiss in times of dire need. This fleet was considered to be a tool of foreign affairs rather than a military asset. Each of the 28 colonies was protected by a phalanx, which was commanded by a 
Syndic, or House leader, and responsible for handling any threats that slipped past the fleet. In times of crisis, Chiss Expansionary Defense Fleet segments drew upon the nearby phalanxes to strengthen themselves and tighten border patrols. The formation of the Chiss Army and Navy was tributary, with 
each Chiss colony world sending a complete phalanx to Csilla for command by the Nuruodo family. In 965 BBY, the Ascendancy passed the Non-Aggression Law, prohibiting preemptive warfare.</p>

     <h3 id="foreignaffairschissascendancy">Foreign Affairs</h3>
     <p>The Chiss were very xenophobic, believing themselves to be superior to all others. Because of this, the Chiss were as isolationist as possible. They rarely engaged in trade with those outside their borders. Despite their isolationism, Chiss goods, like charrics, could be found in Republic 
markets by 3951 BBY.  When the Sith Empire returned in 3681 BBY to fight the Republic once more during the Great Galactic War and the Cold War, the Chiss Ascendancy was the only actual ally of the Empire, unlike all the species that the Empire subjugated, and some Chiss were known to serve as 
Imperial Agents. When the Eternal Empire conquered the galaxy in 3636 BBY, the Ascendancy ceded its two richest industrial worlds to Emperor Arcann as tribute in exchange for the Ascendancy's continued autonomy. When the Eternal Empire fell to the Alliance six years later, the Ascendancy quickly 
reclaimed the worlds with the aid of the Sith Empire. At some point prior to 1000 BBY, the Brotherhood of Darkness raided the Unknown Regions to bolster their own forces. As part of this operation, a regiment of Chiss were relocated to Thule. Nearly a thousand years later, before the Clone Wars, 
Count Dooku recruited the Force-sensitive Chiss General Sev'rance Tann and her lover, Vandalor, to the armed forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the Clone Wars, the Ascendancy held diplomatic meetings with the Republic, with Aristocra Sev'eere'nuruodo meeting with the Republic's 
representative, the Chiss Jedi Padawan Kung'urama'nuruodo. The Chiss' position was to stay neutral in the conflict. During the later stages of the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Chiss joined the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances in the fight against the invaders, and apparently maintained closer relations 
with the Galactic Alliance following the peace treaty.One of the Ascendancy's major conflicts was the Swarm War. The insect creatures, the Killiks were disrupting Chiss space. This would eventually lead to all out war against the species when Jacen Solo and his friends executed a sneak attack on Supply 
Depot Thrago to prevent Jacen's catastrophic vision from coming true. The Galactic Alliance would eventually be caught up in the mix once they realized it was the Dark Nest's influence on the colony that was provoking the war. The war was ended after the capture of the Colony's leader, Raynar Thul, and 
the destruction of the Dark Nest with the death of Lomi Plo after the death of Welk. During the Sith–Imperial War, the Chiss were dragged into the conflict on the Fel Empire's side when Fehlaaur'aitel'loro, the Chiss diplomat to the Empire, was made a Moff, the head of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps and 
placed on the Moff Council. Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire allowed the Ascendancy to retain much of its autonomy. However, it maintained some control over Ascendancy by making heads of Chiss houses high-ranking officials within the new Empire. It also gave the Ascendancy control over large tracts of the 
Unknown Regions. In 138 ABY, as the Second Imperial Civil War escalated following the poisoning of Dac and the return of Darth Krayt, the Ascendancy remained neutral, though, like the Hapes Consortium, it did not even reply to Imperial requests for open liaisons.</p>

     <h4>Quick Summary</h4>
     <p>The Mandalorians were a clan-based cultural group that was composed of members from multiple species all bound by a common creed, language and code, and played a particularly important role in galactic history as legendary warriors with a fearsome reputation as conquerors as well as mercenaries 
and bounty hunters.Originating around the year 9991 BBY, on the planet of Mandalore in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories, the Mandalorians' way of life revolved around honor and war, being led by a sole ruler known as the Mand'alor, whose Protectors established a balance of control in the Mandalorians' 
warrior clan society. As a result of their warrior culture, the Mandalorians launched several wars of expansion by the time of the Old Republic-era, colonizing nearby worlds such as Krownest, Ordo, and Concord Dawn, sucessfully establishing their own sector, known as Mandalorian Space.Throughout their 
history, several types of Mandalorian warriors came into existance, such as Mandalorian crusaders, rally masters, and Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, all of who waged war on the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order, conflicts that according to legends, involved a Mand'alor who went by the name of Mandalore 
the Great.In spite of this, relations between the Mandalorians and the Jedi were not always hostile, as Tarre Vizsla, a human Mandalorian, was inducted into the Jedi Order as a child, creating a lightsaber known as the Darksaber around the year 1050 BBY. Tarre eventually founded House Vizsla, claiming 
the position of Mand'alor, with the Darksaber becoming a symbol of leadership for House Vizsla as well as the entire Mandalorian people.However, after Vizsla's death, members of his house raided the Jedi Temple during the fall of the Old Republic, stealing the Darksaber and using it to reunify the Mandalorian 
people, waging war once more on the Jedi Order. Unfortunately, the final conflict between the Mandalorian warlords and the Jedi at the planet Mandalore led to a a cataclysm that turned much of it's surface into a lifeless white desert, rendering it uninhabitable outside of hermetically sealed dome cities. 
After their defeat, the Mandalorians remained isolated in their sector well into the High Republic Era, not attempting to wage another war on either the Jedi nor the Republic, with which they coexisted through treaties. However, the Mandalorians' warrior ways and desire for conquest remained alive, eventually 
leading to infighting and civil wars.However, although Mandalore was still under control of traditional Mandalorian warriors, much of the planet's population had become part of a pacifist movement known as the New Mandalorians, led by the young Duchess Satine Kryze of House Kryze, with the traditionalist warriors 
being forced to use violence to hold on to power. Eventually, around the year 42 BBY, a civil war broke out between the pacifist New Mandalorian movement and the martial traditionalists, who wished to maintain their warrior heritage. Mandalore's capital of Keldabe was destroyed during the Mandalorian Civil War, 
and many perished during the conflict, including Duke Adonai Kryze, Satine's father. Satine herself had to remain under protection from the Jedi Order, as the traditionalists sent bounty hunters after her. However, Mandalore's traditionalist minority was eventually defeated during the war, being exiled to 
Mandalore's moon of Concordia. While the Death Watch, a traditionalist group under Mand'alor Pre Vizsla, wished to retake their homeworld, the Old Mandalorians scattered across the galaxy as mercenaries.During the Clone Wars, members of the warrior culture would align themselves with both sides of the conflict, 
which was secretly orchestrated by the Sith Order, who hired the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett to become the clone template for the Grand Army of the Republic, with Fett's clones being trained by the Mandalorian Protectors, while the Death Watch briefly joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, in 
hopes of reclaiming Mandalore. Under the New Mandalorian government, Mandalore remained neutral and participated in the Council of Neutral Systems as a leading member. However thanks to being backed up by the criminal conglomerate known as the Shadow Collective, Death Watch was able to topple the ruling New Mandalorian 
regime, but the machinations of Maul, leader of the Collective, led to another civil war among the Death Watch, which split into the Collective-backed Mandalorian super commandos, and the Mandalore resistance, which was supported by the Republic. However, the conflict culminated in the occupation of Mandalore by the 
Galactic Republic and its subsequent government, the Galactic Empire, while Concord Dawn, the Protectors' headquarters, was transformed into a protectorate.Following the rise of the Empire, Bo-Katan Kryze was made Regent of Mandalore, but she refused to follow Emperor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, she was replaced with 
Gar Saxon, a former Mandalorian super commando, who was installed as Viceroy over Mandalore, his rule enforced by the Imperial Super Commandos. As with many worlds in the galaxy, Mandalore was oppressed under Imperial rule, with weapons such as the Arc Pulse Generator being developed to pacify and rein in the war-like 
civilization, while the Mandalorian Protectors under Fenn Rau were forced to seve the Empire on Concord Dawn. However, during the Galactic Civil War, the Empire's rule on Mandalore was opposed by the Mandalorian resistance, which was supported by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and was also joined by Fenn Rau 
after the Protectors' destruction. After the deaths of Gar Saxon and his brother and successor, Governor Tiber Saxon, Bo-Katan Kryze, after receiving the Darksaber from Sabine Wren of Clan Wren, assumed the position of Mand'alor. Kryze united the Mandalorian resistance as another civil war erupted on Mandalore, a part 
of the galaxy-wide struggle against Imperial rule. Kryze's reign as Mand'alor was short lived, however, and the Empire started the Great Purge of Mandalore, killing millions of Mandalorians during the Night of a Thousand Tears, while Kryze lost the Darksaber to Moff Gideon.After the fall of the Empire and the rise 
of the New Republic, and following the Empire's Great Purge of Mandalore, the surviving Mandalorians went into hiding. One such group, the Tribe, hid in a covert on Nevarro. The Tribe, which was secretly part of the Children of the Watch, followed the Way of the Mandalore, an ancient religion that had fallen out 
of mainstream Mandalorian society. However, the Tribe was forced to relocate after it's members revealed themselves to protect one of their own, the bounty hunter Din Djarin, from an Imperial remnant, which afterwards wiped out most of the Tribe's members. Djarin, who had been tasked with returning the Force-sensitive 
foundling Grogu to the Jedi Order, was aided in his task by several notable individuals, including Bo-Katan Kryze, Mandalore's former ruler, and Boba Fett, the son of Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett.After the hunt for Grogu was over, Djarin attempted to return to the Tribe, which had relocated to the Glavis Ringworld, 
only to be expelled by it's members when they discovered that he had removed his helmet, which went against the Way of the Mandalore. Djarin and Fett joined forces once more, leading Fett's gotra in it's war against the Pyke Syndicate, during which he was reunited with Grogu, who had decided to rejoin him. Fett and Djarin 
eventually defeated the Pykes, allowing Fett to establish himself as Tatooine's reigning crime lord, while Djarin and Grogu left the planet.</p>

     <h3 id="societyandculturemandalorian">Society and Culture</h3>
     <h4>The Mandalorian People</h4>
     <p>Mandalorians were some of the most feared warriors in the galaxy. As prideful warriors, they held combat as the cornerstone to their culture, their individual identity, and spirit. Mandalorians shared a strong code[29] of honor that could be invoked to settle disputes with one-on-one combat that would conclude with 
the death of one opponent. This affinity and tradition for single combat extended beyond justice, however, as Mandalorians even sought single combat simply for the glory of fighting a great opponent, such as a Jedi Knight, and even used it to settle leadership disputes. However, some in House Vizsla refused to accept 
non-Mandalorians like Maul from ever becoming ruler of Mandalore via such traditions. Maul himself had Prime Minister Almec lie to the Mandalorian people by claiming that Satine Kryze had killed Pre Vizsla, Maul's predecessor. The Darksaber was appropriated by House Vizsla as a symbol of authority and leadership used to 
unify the Mandalorians. The weapon became revered and was passed down to new leaders who defeated the previous leader in combat, with claiming the weapon in any other way being considered illegitimate. As well as Galactic Basic Standard, Mandalorians spoke Mando'a, whose written form was also known as Mandalorian. Mandalorian 
clan structure was like a pyramid, with the ruler, or Mand'alor, at the top and the Mandalorian Protectors enforcing their rule. Below them were the political factions known as houses, which were made up of family clans. One example was House Vizsla, which was comprised of Clan Vizsla and Clan Wren. Under the rule of Duchess 
Satine Kryze and the New Mandalorian government during the Clone Wars, the Mandalorians had mostly rejected their martial ancestral ways but maintained a police force and secret service, who wielded electropoles and shields. Though Mandalorians were usually distinctly human, one did not need to be human to become one. Instead, 
what one needed to do was follow the Mandalorian Creed. Thus, some individuals, non-humans included, could be adopted into the Mandalorian creed as foundlings, children raised to become Mandalorian warriors. The Mandalorians viewed the foundlings as the future, and any Mandalorian with a foundling in their care was duty-bound 
to reunite it with their kind or to raise them, acting as the child's parent. When a foundling came of age, if he or she had not yet been reunited with its kind, it could decide to leave or join the Mandalorians. Although Mandalorians who had been foundlings were treated no differently than any other Mandalorians, possessing 
the right to bear their armor and even to form their own clans, discrimination towards foundlings was observed to be present within Mandalorian organizations. Several notable foundlings included Grogu and Din Djarin, both of Clan Mudhorn, as well as the famed Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Some Mandalorians, such as the 
Children of the Watch, followed ancient religions such as the Way of the Mandalore. Mandalorians who followed the Way did not consider others as true Mandalorians, while mainstream Mandalorian regarded the Children of the Watch as religious zealots. </p>
     <h4>Gear, Combat, and Art</h4>
     <p>Mandalorian armor developed a legendary reputation that was feared across the galaxy and was visually distinctive with its honeycomb plate patterns and menacing T-shaped visors. The armor was made of beskar, a metal extremely resistant to damage and malleable enough to be forged into armor. The signature innovation of 
the Mandalorians was the mining and tempering of beskar. The metal was found only on Mandalorian worlds. An ancient tradition and vital part of Mandalorian culture was forging the beskar into armor, which was carried out by Mandalorian Armorers, who could also forge beskar into other gear like whistling birds. Beskar was also 
used to forge weapons such as crushgaunts and beskads. The Mandalorians were very protective of their armor and the beskar, claiming that it belonged only to them and refusing to give it to anyone not related to the warrior culture, as evidenced when the Mandalorian warrior Din Djarin only allowed Boba Fett to retake possession 
of his Mandalorian armor after learning that Fett was of Mandalorian heritage. However, despite the Mandalorians' claim that both their armor and beskar belonged only to them, several non-Mandalorians, such as the crime lord Dryden Vos, Trandoshan big game hunter Garnac, and Tempest Runner Lourna Dee had Mandalorian armor in 
their possession. Furthermore, Boba Fett's infamy led to several bounty hunters emulating the skilled mercenary by wearing knockoff Mandalorian armor, since knockoff Mandalorian gear was in no short supply in the bounty hunter profession. Despite not wearing a full set of Mandalorian armor, bounty hunter Carib Diss possessed 
a Mandalorian vambrace equipped with whistling birds. Additionally, some non-Mandalorian individuals also sported beskar equipment, such as Enfys Nest, who had beskar gauntlets, and a unidentified Arcona bounty hunter, who wore a set of beskar armor. On top of the fabled armor, Mandalorian warriors were equipped with anti-Jedi 
tools such as jetpacks, magnetized boots, tactical displays, and armed gauntlets that featured weaponry and tools designed to combat the abilities of the Jedi. Some of this weaponry not only helped combat but outright mimicked Jedi abilities, such as their wrist-mounted sonic repulsors that knocked objects away like a Force push 
would. They generally favored WESTAR-35 blaster pistols and Z-6 jetpacks, which could project missiles. The Rising Phoenix was the training Mandalorians undertook to enhance their jetpack skills. The archetypal Mandalorian starfighter design was called the Kom'rk-class fighter/transport. Mandalorian warriors possessed advanced 
combat training from their many wars that dated to before the Republic's existence. However, it wasn't until their conflicts with the Jedi that they developed their signature combat style. This style entailed a Mandalorian utilizing a mix of melee, ranged, and hand-to-hand techniques while incorporating the technology in his or 
her vambraces to surprise a Jedi Knight in combat, allowing the Mandalorian to finish the Jedi off. Mandalorian warriors continued to utilize this style of combat against the Jedi for some time as well as against other opponents. They were also known to perform headbutts known as Keldabe kisses, a term which shared it's name 
with Mandalore's former capital of Keldabe. The Darksaber became a feared weapon in the days of the Old Republic as Mandalorian warriors of House Vizsla used it to slay many Jedi. When the Jedi claimed the weapon and stored it in the Jedi Temple, Mandalorian warriors would raid the Temple to reclaim the weapon that had become 
a symbol of their warrior ways. During the Clone Wars, the weapon also came to symbolize leadership of Death Watch as well as House Vizsla. Cubism was a popular Mandalorian art movement during the Clone Wars. After the war, the paintings that had depicted the awfulness of war were used to promote and glorify it instead. 
Mandalorians typically trended towards strong angled and hexagonal lines, such as diamond and honeycomb shapes, in their architecture, vehicles, clothing, and even haircuts. The Darksaber notably reflected this style, with an angular pommel, hand guard, and blade emitter. Sabine Wren, a Mandalorian and a member of the Spectres, 
was a talented graffiti artist who personalized and painted her armor. A statue of Tarre Vizsla was erected on Mandalore and became a symbol for hope and Mandalorian history. When the Empire constructed an outpost on the statue, some Mandalorians saw this as offensive, eventually destroying the outpost to restore the emblematic 
statue's appearance. Several Mandalorians decorated their beskar armor with their clan symbols. In addition, some Mandalorian armor bore the mythosaur skull emblem, one of the traditional symbols in Mandalorian iconography. </p>

     <h3 id="historymandalorian">History</h3>
     <p>Originating from the planet Mandalore in the Outer Rim, around the year 9991 BBY, the Mandalorians' history was one of warriors who would become feared throughout the galaxy, gaining a reputation as mercenaries and bounty hunters. They were also known to ride mythosaurs, and the mythosaur skull emblem was one of the 
traditional symbols in Mandalorian iconography. However, long before the Mandalorian cataclysm, the creature had gone extinct. Even prior to the formation of the Old Republic, war dominated their way of life. This life of war eventually turned to dreams of expansion, and a group of Mandalorian warriors known as the Mandalorian 
crusaders began waging war against other peoples to conquer their worlds. Armor-clad and wielding swords, the crusaders laid waste to many worlds during their wars. The crusaders conquered several worlds and systems beyond their own, among them the planets of Krownest as well as Concord Dawn, a planet that bore the scars of a 
hundred wars, with almost a third of its planetary mass fractured and reduced to space rubble. These early conquests remained part of the Mandalore sector during the later years of the Galactic Republic and into the reign of the Galactic Empire. During the Old Republic-era, Mandalorian rally masters, who wore distinct red armor, 
served as battlefield commanders during the Mandalorian wars of expansion. Eventually, the crusaders' expansion spread to the Inner Rim, where they devastated the planet Ubduria out of contempt for the native Ubdurians, whom they viewed as dishonorable cowards. In ancient times, a group of Mandalorian warriors known as the 
Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders existed. During the Clone Wars, the Trandoshan big game hunter Garnac owned a Neo-Crusader's helmet. The Mandalorian crusaders' expansion eventually brought them into conflict with the Jedi Order and the Republic they protected. According to ancient songs, Mandalore the Great, who held the title of 
Mand'alor, was involved in the conflict. Their first confrontations with the Jedi Knights took the Mandalorians by surprise: their use of the Force and the powers it granted them was a challenge that they had never seen before. However, the prideful nature of the Mandalorians would not allow that disadvantage to stand, and they 
began to devise ways to overcome the powers of the enigmatic Jedi. The result was a major advancement in the development of Mandalorian technology, specifically their arsenal and their infamous armor. They also developed a fighting style that combined their entire arsenal and skills to allow them to counteract the Jedi's 
supernatural abilities. With these new technologies, the Mandalorians began to win their share of conflicts with the Jedi, and their warriors earned the reputation of being capable of confronting and defeating Jedi Knights. The generations-long conflict ensured an enmity that lasted for several wars and was remembered by the 
wider galaxy even millennia later during the Clone Wars. These clashes between the Mandalorians and the Jedi Order became immortalized through cubist murals displayed in Mandalore's capital city of Sundari and on the moon Concordia. Despite their near-continuous conflicts, the Mandalorians and the Jedi were not always in conflict. 
The most prominent example of this was when the Mandalorian-born Tarre Vizsla, founder of the powerful House Vizsla, was inducted into the Jedi Order as a child. True to his Mandalorian nature, Vizsla distinguished himself from his Jedi peers by creating a unique lightsaber: the Darksaber. At some point in his life, Tarre Vizsla 
became the Mand'alor, the sole ruler of Mandalore and a revered figure among his people. Following his death, the Jedi recovered the Darksaber and returned it to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Mandalorians later honored Vizsla by building a large statue of him on Mandalore to cement his legacy. During the last centuries of the Old 
Republic, the Mandalorians struck at the very heart of their enemies' power: members of House Vizsla infiltrated the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and stole Tarre Vizsla's Darksaber. They used the saber to conquer the entirety of Mandalore and united the diverse houses and clans throughout their territory. Despite the unity that House 
Vizsla had brought to Mandalore, such was the warrior temperament of the Mandalorians that it did not last. Constant warfare and relentless campaigns of conquest ravaged Mandalore. Warlords from various clans emerged to fight the Jedi, but also to fight among themselves. The last great struggle between the Mandalorian warlords and 
the Jedi occurred on Mandalore itself, and caused a cataclysmic event that devastated the planet, scorching much of its surface into a lifeless, white desert. This event ended the war between the Mandalorians and the Jedi, as well as the Mandalorians' dreams of expansion. As a result of their homeworld's devastation, a major focus 
on reconstruction occupied the warriors for a time; the uninhabitable conditions of Mandalore's surface forced them to adapt, just as they had adapted to the Jedi's use of the Force. Instead of abandoning Mandalore, they constructed sealed dome cities, such as the capital city of Sundari. Other Mandalorian clans chose to settle on 
worlds of the Mandalore sector, such as Clan Wren on the snow planet of Krownest, while the Mandalorian Protectors established a base on the third moon of Concord Dawn. As the victorious Jedi helped establish the new Galactic Republic as the dominant galactic government, the Mandalorians remained isolated in their sector. 
Mandalorians' warrior ways and desire for conquest remained alive, eventually leading to civil war. During the Battle of Kur in the High Republic Era, Admiral Pevel Kronara of the Republic Defense Coalition noted that the Mandalorians had been relatively peaceful since before his birth. In the years prior to the Invasion of Naboo, 
another conflict broke out between the Mandalorian people: the Mandalorian Civil War. The civil war was fought between competing ideals within Mandalorian society, including traditionalists who supported Mandalore's warrior past and the New Mandalorians, led by Satine Kryze. Also involved were the Mandalorian Protectors of Concord 
Dawn, an elite group of warriors sworn to defend the Concord Dawn system. At the end of the civil war, Satine Kryze ruled as the Duchess of Mandalore, and the warrior clans were exiled to Concordia. Some of these clans became the Death Watch, plotting their coup against the new regime, while others left Concordia and resettled in 
other parts of the galaxy, becoming the Old Mandalorians. These Old Mandalorians started working as private mercenaries, with no interest in revenge. At some point before 32 BBY, a series of conflicts known as the Mandalorian Civil Wars took place, in which the Mandalorian commando[74] and foundling Jango Fett participated. It was 
during the wars that the skilled warrior obtained his distinctive Mandalorian armor. Satine gradually rebuilt following the damages caused by the war. The considerable number of deaths had left Satine with a fierce hatred of violence, and she became a staunch pacifist. She reformed Mandalorian way of life. She also established a 
Mandalorian Government Council that had several ministers, a cabinet which was led by a Prime Minister. By the time of the Clone Wars, the position was occupied by Almec. Under her rule, Mandalore prospered and turned into a modern and peaceful society. This new government also eventually joined the Galactic Republic. In the final 
years of the Republic, Jango Fett was considered the best bounty hunter in the galaxy. The Mandalorian bounty hunter's reputation attracted the attention of the Sith Order, and he was offered to become the clone template for the Grand Army of the Republic on Kamino. Fett accepted the offer, and the Kaminoan cloners used his genetic 
material to create genetically modified clone troopers, as well as two unaltered clones, Omega and Alpha, the latter whom Jango would take as his son and name Boba Fett, teaching him their family's trade. The Mandalorian armor Fett wore inspired that of the clone troopers. Additionally the Mandalorian Protectors also aided the Republic 
in training the clone troopers, with at least one of Fett's clones, CC-1138, being trained by an ex-Journeyman Protector. Fett's clones acted as the Republic's backbone during it's war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a galaxy-wide conflict known as the Clone Wars. When the Clone Wars erupted, Satine Kryze made sure that 
Mandalore and the New Mandalorians remained neutral and continued to prosper. She then became leader of the Council of Neutral Systems, a Galactic Senate conglomerate of 1,500 star systems who wished to stay out of the conflict. </p>

     <h4>Quick Summary</h4>
     <p>The Mandalorians—known in Mando'a as the Mando'ade, or "Children of Mandalore"—were a nomadic group of clan-based people consisting of members from multiple species, all bound by a common culture.In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. 
The leader of the Mandalorians was known as the Mand'alor, translating to "Sole Ruler" and was rendered as "Mandalore" in Basic. Throughout their history, the Mandalorians were frequently allied with the Sith, perhaps most notably the Sith Lord Exar Kun, and held a certain distrust and general dislike for the Jedi Order. However, 
they would not hesitate to cooperate with the Jedi if a partnership between the two groups was mutually beneficial. In later years, the Mandalorians moved away from their obsessively war-like and conqueror ways and instead, most became bounty hunters and mercenaries, selling their skills to various individuals and factions in the 
galaxy. However, the Mandalorian Protectors sided with the Alliance to Restore the Republic ever since about 3 ABY and even continued to serve the Alliance of Free Planets, the New Republic, and finally the Galactic Alliance.When Boba Fett took the title of Mandalore years later, they were approached by the powerful unknown empire 
of the Yuuzhan Vong to aid them as wealthy mercenaries, and while the offer was accepted (mainly because the other option would have been enslavement of the Mandalorian homeworld), Boba managed to feed information to the New Republic, and while the Mandalorians continued to fight for the Vong in the early Yuuzhan Vong War, they soon 
betrayed them and fought with the many other factions defending the galaxy. After the war ended, the Second Galactic Civil War began, and Jaina Solo, daughter of Han and Leia, came to Fett asking to be trained, given the Mandalorians' famous reputation as legendary warriors against the Jedi. The Mandalorians ironically fought alongside 
the New Jedi Order, their former enemies in the crusades many years before and the Alliance-in-exile in this conflict. With training from Fett, and from others, Jaina killed her brother Darth Caedus, ending the war. Ultimately, in the span of over four thousand years, Mandalorians slowly changed from the feared Mandalorian Crusaders 
of the Sith Empires, to the elite soldiers of the Jedi Coalition and later the reorganized Galactic Alliance, fighting for a cause rather than mainly for credits and the destruction of worlds.Mandalorians wore very distinctive battle armor, including helmets with T-shaped visors that covered the entirety of their faces, and would provide 
inspiration for the helmets of the Republic's clone troopers. These helmets would eventually become strongly associated with the Mandalorian people.</p>  

     <h3 id="historymandalorian">History</h3>
     <p>The Mandalorians began as the humanoid Taung species from the planet Coruscant. Intense fighting with the thirteen Human nations of Coruscant known as the Battalions of Zhell began millennia before the Republic, and when a powerful volcano nearly wiped out the humans and darkened the skies over Coruscant, the Taung came to call 
themselves the Dha Werda Verda—the "Warriors of the Shadow". Despite the volcano's devastating effect, the Taung were eventually driven off Coruscant and took refuge on the world of Roon. Led by the warlord known as Mandalore the First, they would conquer another planet in the Outer Rim in 7000 BBY, which they named Mandalore after their 
leader. The Taung took on the name Mandalorians and were seen by many as the most skilled fighters in the galaxy, thriving in battle. These Mandalorian Crusaders were known for their use of cutting-edge weaponry and held to a strict code of honor, and wore armor known simply as "Crusader Armor" that differed from one soldier to the next. 
For thousands of years, Mandalore's new inhabitants would not stray far from the Mandalore sector, instead venturing on a series of further conquests to capture the worlds of Ordo, Gargon, and Shogun. When the Mandalorians came to the nearby Mandallia, though, the Mandallian Giant natives not only repelled the invaders' assault, but many 
came to join the Mandalorian culture, having impressed the Mandalorians with their strength and prowess. But nearly three thousand years after Mandalore's conquest, at a point prior to 4000 BBY, the Mandalorians began to expand their ongoing crusade outward and engaged the Nevoota species in a conflict that would lead to the extermination 
of the Nevoota and the deification of war in the Mandalorian culture, personified as the destroyer god, Kad Ha'rangir. Shorty before 4000 BBY, the Mandalorians were led by a new Mand'alor, Mandalore the Indomitable, and in their continuing campaign of expansion, the Mand'alor led a raid on the planet Iskadrell. There, the Mandalorians 
freed the slaves of the Iskalloni, taking many of them into their culture, including a young Antos Wyrick. Another victim of the Mandalorian crusade was the planet Basilisk. As the Mandalorians invaded, the Galactic Republic sent a relief force, under the command of Jedi Master Sidrona Diath, to the aid of the Basiliskans. Even with 
Republic support, the Basiliskans found their lines being overrun by the more numerous Mandalorians, and upon realizing that the they were going to lose the battle, the Basiliskans decided to poison their own planet so that the conquerors would not be able to use the world. Basilisk fell, but because the planet's surface was virtually 
destroyed, the Mandalorians decided to abandon the world and move on, though not before pillaging a sizable number of Basilisk war droids for future use. The Mandalorians also captured a large number of the reptilian Basiliskans, and through centuries of warfare they degenerated into little more than war mounts and beasts of burden, becoming 
known as "Lagartoz War Dragons". In 32 BBY, Jango Fett was recruited by Darth Tyranus—in truth the former Jedi Master Dooku, now a Count of his homeworld of Serenno and a Sith Lord—to be the genetic template for an army of clones being grown on Kamino for the Republic. In addition to donating his genetic material, Fett would stay on with 
the Kaminoans as a military consultant for the Grand Army of the Republic, passing on many aspects of the Mandalorian culture to his clones; he assisted in the design of the armor worn by the clone troopers, evident in the similarities between their armor and Fett's own, including the distinctive T-visor of their helmets. Fett also helped 
to create the flash training regimen used to instruct all of the young clones, including in it the traditional Mandalorian song Vode An as a useful tool to help instill within them a sense of purpose, modifying it slightly in order to give it meaning for soldiers serving the Republic. While Fett trained the Alpha-class ARC troopers personally, 
he recruited a team of one hundred other training sergeants collectively known as the Cuy'val Dar—seventy-five of whom were other Mandalorians—to train the Grand Army's clone commandos. These Mandalorian sergeants, including the likes of Walon Vau, Kal Skirata, and Rav Bralor, were responsible for a massive influx of Mandalorian culture into 
the clone ranks. Several clones took Mandalorian names for themselves, while others appropriated Mandalorian slang and curses. Others took to Mandalorian songs and chants, like the Dha Werda Verda, as morale boosters. Kal Skirata made a point of teaching his clones about their Mandalorian heritage, and even adopted the six Null ARC troopers 
and several commandos as his sons per Mandalorian custom. Some clones, however, did not take to their Mandalorian heritage and even came to resent it after Mandalore aligned itself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and began fighting against the Republic and its clone army. In addition to those clones produced professionally for 
the Grand Army, Jango Fett had also commissioned a single clone for himself, possessing none of the genetic modification found in the standard clone troopers, who would act as his son and heir. Fett's son, Boba, would go on to have a major impact on Mandalorian history. Mandalorian influence within the Grand Army began to wane with the production 
of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's second clone army. Created on Coruscant and it's moon, Centax-2, these troopers were bred using Spaarti cloning cylinders, reaching maturity within a year and received a shortened flash-training regime which resulted in the loss of their Mandalorian heritage and less proficiency in key areas such as marksmanship. 
Under the Galactic Empire, the clones' Mandalorian heritage was gradually phased out as future clones were grown from a variety of other genetic templates. However, following the Clone Wars' end, many clones deserted and fled to Mandalore, where Kal Skirata had set up a haven for clones who wished to leave Republic/Imperial service for a new life.</p>
